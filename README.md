## Random-Words Paragrapgh Generator (with Dictionary)

<br/>
This Javascript application is a random-words paragrapgh generator. The words chosen are the top 10000 most-searched words by Google. 
<br/>
This project is built with HTML5, CSS3 (with mobile view taken into consideration) and modern Javascript.
<br/><br/>
This app is an extended version of my another application (see the previous app from here: [Random Paragrapgh Generator](https://github.com/ahmed-alawi-ba/Random-Paragraph-Generator)). **But in this app a new and important functionality was added, where the user can click in any word from the random generated words, and the word definitions will be displayed.**
<br/><br/>


**You can run the app from here: [Random Paragrapgh Generator with Dictionary](https://ahmed-alawi-ba.github.io/Random-Paragraph-Generator-with-Dictionary/)**


<br/>
<br/>

This project uses **Wordnik API**, which is the world's biggest online English dictionary, by number of words.
<br/>
You can go to [Wordnik Developer Website](https://developer.wordnik.com/) to request for an API key. Or if you can use mine if you like, but please consider giving them some support.
